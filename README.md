# Hi there, I'm Kelvin 

I find that I now enjoy the full spectrum of data work: designing data warehouses, writing efficient SQL queries, building automated pipelines, and creating visualizations that tell compelling stories. I am continuously expanding my toolkit and exploring new ways to work with data.

Here are a couple of projects I've put together so far:

### 📊 **[Stock Analytics Pipeline](https://github.com/kevkaleido/stock-analytics-pipeline)**
End-to-end stock market analysis pipeline: Python data extraction → SQL analysis → Power BI visualization. Analyzes stocks across S&P 500, NASDAQ & Russell 2000, calculating TSR, volatility, Sharpe ratio and other key metrics.

### 🏗️ **[SQL Data Warehouse Project](https://github.com/kevkaleido/sql-data-warehouse-project)**
Built a full data warehouse from scratch - basically learned how to take raw data and turn it into something organized and queryable. Covers the whole pipeline from ETL processes to creating reports. Pretty proud of how this one turned out!

### 📊 **[SQL Data Analytics Project](https://github.com/kevkaleido/sql_data_analytics_project)**
A collection of SQL scripts where I've been experimenting with different types of analysis - exploring databases, tracking trends over time, doing customer segmentation, and basically asking "what story is this data trying to tell me?" It's been fun getting creative with queries and seeing what patterns emerge.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
