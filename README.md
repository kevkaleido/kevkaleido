# Hi there, I'm Kelvin 

I find that I now enjoy the full spectrum of data work: designing data warehouses, writing efficient SQL queries, building automated pipelines, and creating visualizations that tell compelling stories. I am continuously expanding my toolkit and exploring new ways to work with data.

Here are a couple of projects I've put together so far:

### **[Stock Analytics Pipeline](https://github.com/kevkaleido/stock-analytics-pipeline)** 
End-to-end stock market analysis pipeline: Python data extraction → SQL analysis → Power BI visualization. Analyzes stocks across S&P 500, NASDAQ & Russell 2000, calculating TSR, volatility, Sharpe ratio and other key metrics.

### **[Data Warehouse](https://github.com/kevkaleido/sql-data-warehouse-project)**
Built a full data warehouse from scratch - basically learned how to take raw data and turn it into something organized and queryable. Covers the whole pipeline from ETL processes to creating reports.

### **[Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/kevkaleido/sql_data_analytics_project)**
This project makes use of SQL scripts for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. The scripts cover various analyses such as database exploration, measures and metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analytics, segmentation, and more. The project represents the next step from the Data Warehouse Project I completed previously


### Tech Stack
