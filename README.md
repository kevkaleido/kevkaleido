# Hey there! 👋

I'm Kelvin, and I'm making the jump into data analysis! Coming from a video production background, I love finding ways to tell compelling stories with data. It's been quite the journey learning SQL, diving into data warehousing, and figuring out how to turn messy data into actually useful insights.

## What I've been working on

Here are a couple of projects I've put together so far:

### 🏗️ [SQL Data Warehouse Project](https://github.com/kevkaleido/sql-data-warehouse-project)
Built a full data warehouse from scratch - basically learned how to take raw data and turn it into something organized and queryable. Covers the whole pipeline from ETL processes to creating reports. Pretty proud of how this one turned out!

### 📊 [SQL Data Analytics Project](https://github.com/kevkaleido/sql_data_analytics_project)
A collection of SQL scripts where I've been experimenting with different types of analysis - exploring databases, tracking trends over time, doing customer segmentation, and basically asking "what story is this data trying to tell me?" It's been fun getting creative with queries and seeing what patterns emerge.

## Let's connect!
Always down to get involved and learn from others who are on a similar path.
